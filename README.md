# Smart Solder Fume Extractor

Embeded smart solder fume extractor using HPM particulate metter sensor.

## Problem Statement

Soldering can produce dust and fumes that are hazardous. In addition, using flux containing rosin produces solder fumes that,  
if inhaled, can result in occupational asthma or worsen, existing asthlatic conditions; as well as cause eye and upper respiratour tract irritation.

Fume extractor devices are available cheaply - For basic needs such tools work great however they are noisy and not clever.
if they are not powered on, they simply donâ€™t work.  
Some devices can be controlled by potentiometer to increase or decrease the fan speed however most of them simply run at full speed.

## Smart Solder Fume extractor

Smart fume extractor can automatically detects bad air quality, activate the fan at a speed that corresponds to the level of particulates. Automatically power on/off the device.
They can record the time of execution of the device and predict a replacement cycle for the fume filter.
Finally they can display the total execution time and a percentage of the filter saturation on a simple display.
